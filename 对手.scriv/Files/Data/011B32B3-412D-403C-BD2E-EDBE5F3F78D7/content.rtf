Elements of the Philosophy of Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738, was an early attempt to popularize the scientific ideas of Isaac Newton. In the book\'a1\'afs frontispiece, Voltaire is seen writing at his desk, and over him a shaft of light from heaven, the light of truth, passes through Newton to Voltaire\'a1\'afs collaborator Madame du Ch\uc0\u226 telet; she reflects that light onto the inspired Voltaire. Voltaire\'a1\'afs book commanded a wide audience, according to Feingold, because \'a1\'b0he was neither a mathematician nor a physicist, but a literary giant aloof from the academic disputes over Newtonian ideas.\'a1\'b1 In other words, Voltaire\'a1\'afs amateurism in science \'a1\'b0was a source of his contemporary appeal, demonstrating for the first time the accessibility of Newton\'a1\'afs ideas to nonspecialists.\'a1\'b1}
