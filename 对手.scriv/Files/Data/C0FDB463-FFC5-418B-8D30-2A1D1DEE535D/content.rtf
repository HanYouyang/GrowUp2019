Many critics of Emily Bront\uc0\u235 \'a1\'afs novel\u160 Wuthering Heights\u160 see its second part as a counter point that comments on, if it does not reverse, the first part, where a romantic reading receives more confirmation. Seeing the two parts as a whole is encouraged by the novel\'a1\'afs sophisticated structure, revealed in its complex use of narrators and time shifts. Granted that the presence of these elements need not argue for an authorial awareness of novelistic construction comparable to that of Henry James, their presence does encourage attempts to unify the novel\'a1\'afs heterogeneous parts. However, any interpretation that seeks to unify all of the novel\'a1\'afs diverse elements is bound to be somewhat unconvincing. This is not because such an interpretation necessarily stiffens into a thesis (although rigidity in any interpretation of this or of any novel is always a danger), but because\u160 Wuthering Heights\u160 has recalcitrant elements of undeniable power that, ultimately, resist inclusion in an all-encompassing interpretation. In this respect,\u160 Wuthering Heightsshares a feature of\u160 Hamlet.}
