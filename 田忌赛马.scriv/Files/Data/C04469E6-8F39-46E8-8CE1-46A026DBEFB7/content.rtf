In humans, the pilomotor reflex leads to the response commonly known as goose bumps, and this response is wildly considered to be vestigial\'a1\'aathat is, something formerly having a greater physiological advantage that at present. It occurs when the tiny muscle at the base of a hair follicle contracts, pulling the hair upright. In animals with feathers, fur, or quills, this create a layer of insulating warm air or a reason for predators to think twice before attacking. But human hair is too puny to serve these functions. Goose bumps in humans may, however, have acquired a\uc0\u160 new role. Like flushing\'a1\'aaanother thermoregulatory (heat-regulating) mechanism\'a1\'aagoose bumps have become linked with emotional responses, notably fear, rage, or the pleasure of, say, listening to beautiful music. They may thus serve as a signal to others.}
