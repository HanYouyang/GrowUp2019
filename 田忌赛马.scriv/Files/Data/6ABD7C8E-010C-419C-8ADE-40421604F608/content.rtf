1.Reviving the practice of using elements of popular music in classical composition, \
an approach that had been in hibernation in the United States during the 1960s, \
composer Glass embraced the ethos of popular music without imitating it. \
2.Glass based two symphonies on music by rock musicians Bowie and Eno, \
but the symphonies\'a1\'af sound is distinctively his. \
3.Popular elements do not appear out of place in Glass\'a1\'afs classical music, \
which from its early days has shared certain harmonies and rhythms with rock music. \
4.Yet this use of popular elements has not made Glass a composer of popular music. \
5.His music is not a version of popular music packaged to attract classical listeners; \
it is high art for listeners steeped in rock rather than the classics.\
